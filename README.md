# Vigilante Up To Jump
A patch for the Sega Master System game Vigilante, by Irem, that changes the controls. Requested by Elfor!

In the unpathed version, one must use both the 1 and 2 buttons in order to jump, while the UP button on the D-Pad has no purpose.
This hack just adds the ability to jump using the UP button on the D-Pad. You can still jump with the 1 and 2 buttons.

## How to install
Use the program FLIPS to install this patch. Simply follow the on-screen prompts in FLIPS and you should have no problems.
